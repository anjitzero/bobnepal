                                <p>Little do public know about him despite his unparalleled contribution to Nepali music. But that is because he is the man behind the hit sounds of many heavyweights in Nepali music. Principal of Nepal Sangeet Vidhyalaya,
                                    he is also a guitarist, composer and above all a veteran recording engineer, who is a scary judge of talent when it comes to music and sound. He is also the Lead guitarist of Mental Radio. It is our privilege to have
                                    Iman Bikram Shah on our judge panel.

                                <p>One of the iconic frontmen of one of the iconic bands in Nepal music, Mukti Shakya is among those few musicians who laid the foundation of rock and blues in Nepal. His career spans decades and his music, international borders!
                                    Such is the legacy of The King of Nepali Blues that he requires little or no introduction Here is The King of Blues, Mukti Shakya - our final judge.

                                <p>She was first thrust into the limelight in the early 2000s when she wore the crown of Miss Nepal. Today her identity extends well beyond the title of a beauty queen to that of a multidimensional public personality - all thanks to her super-accomplished career that spans from being a celebrated media personality to speaking for social justice of the many, and from co-founding Himalayan Climate Initiative to lending her expertise to many other corporate and non-profit firms.

                                    Meet our host, Malvika Subba.</p>
