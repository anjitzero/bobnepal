                <p>The Nepali music has had better days. The fact that we used to have sold out band concerts and never-ending rock tours shouldn't shock the YouTube generations today - ours was one of the most vibrant and rising band cultures in the entire
                    South Asia - but it has been a long time since then, the golden era of Nepali band music. It has indeed been really long since the last greatest gig.
                </p>
                <p>Battle of the Bands Nepal is an initiative to revive Nepali band music through a massive band competition culminating in what has been envisioned to be the greatest band concert in the modern history of Nepali music. The competition will
                    be televised internationally as well as streamed online and will mark the beginning of the next golden era of band music in South Asia.</p>
